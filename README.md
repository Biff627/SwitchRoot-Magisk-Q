# SwitchRoot-Q-Overclock
**Warning! Using this overclock will degrade your battery faster than the normal performance mode overclock @ 1.75ghz! Emulators will run better though :)**
## Introduction
**This repository contains 4 images for the switchroot Q release. A stock boot.img, an overclocked boot.img @ 2.09ghz, and 2 magisk patched images. Magisk 21.3 and up can just be flashed in TWRP so these magisk patched images won't be here for long.**<br />

## Installation
**Flash Images**
1. Place `boot_OC.img` in switchroot/install on your switchroot partitioned sd card.<br />
2. Rename the boot image of your choosing to `boot.img`
3. Boot Hekate
4. Navigate to Partition SD card and press `Flash Android`
5. Boot switchroot, enable Performance mode & enjoy your overclock!
