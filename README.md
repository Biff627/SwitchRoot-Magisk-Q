# SwitchRoot-Q-Overclock
**Warning!**<br />
**Overclocking to 2.09ghz accelerates battery degradation greatly.**

## Introduction
**This repository contains a TWRP flashable zip that has an overclocked boot.img and an edited power profile to enable a 2.09ghz overclock.**<br />
These zips are for May 10th's Switchroot OTA . If your current switchroot version is newer than May 10th, do not flash these zips

2091 OC will overclock in both handheld and dock
2091 Dock OC will only overclock while in the dock

Magisk zips have been removed since they have become useless

## Installation
1. Flash `2091 OC*.zip` or `2091 Dock OC*.zip` in TWRP
2. Boot switchroot, enable Performance Mode & enjoy your overclock!
